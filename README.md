SportsHub - Team Sports Management System
SportsHub is a comprehensive team sports management platform designed to streamline athletic organization operations for administrators, coaches, and players. Built with modern web technologies including Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, this application provides role-based access to manage teams, schedules, announcements, and player information in a centralized, user-friendly interface. The platform features three distinct user roles: Administrators have full system access for managing users, teams, coaches, and game schedules; Coaches can manage their assigned teams with tools for scheduling practices and meetings, viewing player information, and posting announcements; Players have access to their personal dashboard, team schedules, teammate directories, and announcements.

The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database through Supabase with Row Level Security policies to ensure data protection, while implementing secure authentication and role-based authorization. The intuitive interface features responsive design with both dark and light modes, mobile-friendly navigation, and real-time updates for schedules and announcements. Key functionalities include team roster management, practice and game scheduling, announcement broadcasting, and user profile management. Future enhancements may include player statistics tracking, injury reporting systems, equipment management, and mobile application development.
